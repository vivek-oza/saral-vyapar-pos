# Story 1.3: Module Selection Interface

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to see a module selection page with a bento grid layout after login/signup,
**so that** I can choose which functionality to access without being overwhelmed by the full dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After successful login, user is redirected to `/{shopusername}/modules` instead of dashboard
2. After successful signup and shop setup, user is redirected to `/{shopusername}/modules`

   - Product Management (blue theme)
   - Inventory View (green theme)
   - Billing View (purple theme)
   - Reports & Analytics (orange theme)
   - Mobile POS (pink theme)
   - Shop Settings (gray theme)
4. Each module card shows an icon, title, description, and "Open Module" action
5. Module cards have hover effects (scale, shadow, color transition)
6. User can click on any module card to navigate to that module's page
7. User can access the full dashboard via "Go to Full Dashboard" button
8. Module selection page is mobile responsive
9. Each module page has a "Back to Modules" button for easy navigation

## Dev Notes

### UX Design Rationale

This feature implements a progressive disclosure pattern that:

- Reduces cognitive load for new users
- Provides clear module organization
- Allows users to focus on specific functionality
- Maintains easy access to full dashboard when needed
- Follows modern app design patterns (similar to Notion, Airtable)

### Module Organization

The six modules represent the core functionality areas:

1. **Product Management**: Category management, product CRUD operations
2. **Inventory View**: Stock tracking, inventory management, alerts
3. **Billing View**: Transaction processing, bill generation, payments
4. **Reports & Analytics**: Business insights, sales reports, KPIs
5. **Mobile POS**: Mobile-optimized POS functionality
6. **Shop Settings**: Shop configuration, settings management, user preferences

### Technical Implementation

**Component Structure:**

- `ModuleSelection.jsx` - Main module selection page
- Individual module pages (`Products.jsx`, `Inventory.jsx`, etc.)
- Updated routing in `App.jsx`
- Modified authentication flow in login/signup forms

**Styling Approach:**

- Bento grid using CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints
- Color-coded modules for visual organization
- Hover effects using Tailwind CSS transitions
- Consistent spacing and typography

**Navigation Flow:**

```
Login/Signup → Module Selection → Individual Module → Back to Modules
                     ↓
              Go to Full Dashboard
```

### Data Models

No new data models required - uses existing User and Shop schemas.

### API Specifications

No new API endpoints required - uses existing authentication endpoints.

## Testing

**Testing Standards:**

- Unit tests for ModuleSelection component
- Integration tests for navigation flow
- Responsive design testing on multiple screen sizes
- User journey testing from login to module access
- Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Login Flow**: User logs in → redirected to modules → can access any module
2. **Signup Flow**: User signs up → completes shop setup → redirected to modules
3. **Module Navigation**: User clicks module card → navigates to module page → can return
4. **Dashboard Access**: User can access full dashboard from modules page
5. **Mobile Experience**: All functionality works on mobile devices
