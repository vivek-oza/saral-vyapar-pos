# Story 1.4: Business Type Terminology Update

## Status

✅ Completed

## Story

**As a** user setting up their shop,
**I want** the business type "Freelancer" to be renamed to "Freelancer or Service",
**so that** it better represents service-based businesses beyond just freelancers

## Prerequisites

- Story 1.1 (User & Shop Onboarding) must be completed
- This is a prerequisite for Story 3.2 (Service-Based Billing System)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Shop setup form displays "Freelancer or Service" instead of "Freelancer" in business type dropdown
2. All navigation menus show "Freelancer or Service Business" instead of "Freelancer Business"
3. Module selection page filters correctly for "Freelancer or Service" business type
4. Dashboard displays "Freelancer or Service" in business type indicator
5. Existing users with "Freelancer" business type continue to work without issues
6. Database stores the updated terminology for new users

## Dev Notes

### Files to Update

- `frontend/src/components/shop/ShopSetupForm.jsx` - Line 218
- `frontend/src/pages/ModuleSelection.jsx` - businessTypes arrays
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Navbar.jsx` - businessTypes arrays and display
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx` - business type display

### Backward Compatibility

Existing users with "Freelancer" business type should continue to work. The system should treat both "Freelancer" and "Freelancer or Service" as equivalent for filtering and display purposes.

### Implementation Approach

```javascript
// Helper function for business type compatibility
const normalizeBusinessType = (businessType) => {
  if (businessType === "Freelancer") return "Freelancer or Service";
  return businessType;
};

// Use in components for display
const displayBusinessType = normalizeBusinessType(user?.shop?.business_type);

// Use in filtering logic
const isServiceBusiness = ["Freelancer", "Freelancer or Service"].includes(
  businessType
);
```

## Testing

- Verify new users can select "Freelancer or Service"
- Verify existing "Freelancer" users see updated terminology in UI
- Test module filtering works for both old and new terminology
- Verify navigation menus display correctly
- Test business type indicators across all pages
