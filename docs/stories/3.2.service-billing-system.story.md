# Story 3.2: Service-Based Billing System for Freelancers

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** freelancer or service provider,
**I want** to create bills directly for services without managing inventory,
**so that** I can quickly bill clients for my services and track payments efficiently

## Prerequisites

- Story 1.1 (User & Shop Onboarding) must be completed
- Story 1.3 (Module Selection Interface) must be completed
- Business type should be set to "Freelancer or Service" during shop setup

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Service Billing Interface

1. User with "Freelancer or Service" business type sees a different billing interface than retail users
2. Service billing page displays three main sections:
   - Top dashboard cards (Daily Collection, Total Pending)
   - Service bill creation form
   - Bill history table with pagination
3. Daily Collection card shows total amount billed today
4. Total Pending card shows sum of all pending bill amounts
5. User can create bills directly without product catalog dependency

### Service Bill Creation Form

6. Bill creation form contains three sections:
   - Customer Details: Client name (required), phone number (required), address (optional)
   - Service Rows: Date (default today, dd/mm/yy format), Service description (text field), Amount per row
   - Actions: "Add New Row" button, "Cancel" button, "Generate Bill" button
7. User can add multiple service rows to a single bill
8. All form fields are editable after bill generation
9. Default payment mode is set to "Pending" but user can edit this field
10. User can manually change bill status between "Pending" and "Received"

### Bill History and Management

11. Bill history table displays: Date, Invoice (Client Name), Amount, Status (Pending/Received), Payment Mode, Actions (Quick Edit, Full Edit, Print)
12. Table includes pagination for large datasets
13. User can perform quick edits for bill status and payment mode with save/cancel functionality
14. User can perform full bill editing including customer details, service items, amounts, and all bill data
15. Quick edit mode allows inline editing with explicit save button to prevent accidental changes
16. Full edit mode opens a modal with complete bill editing capabilities including add/remove service rows
17. Print functionality generates a compact bill with business details and legal compliance note
18. Bills are searchable and filterable by status, date range, and client name

### Bill Generation and Printing

19. Generated bills include business header with shop details
20. Bills contain a short legal compliance note for the payer
21. Bill format is compact and professional
22. Print functionality works across different browsers and devices
23. Bills are automatically assigned sequential invoice numbers

### Bill Editing Capabilities

24. Two distinct editing modes: Quick Edit and Full Edit
25. Quick Edit allows inline editing of status and payment mode with explicit save functionality
26. Full Edit opens a comprehensive modal for editing all bill aspects
27. Full Edit supports adding/removing service rows, editing customer details, and updating amounts
28. All edits include proper validation and error handling
29. Edit operations maintain data integrity and update totals automatically

## Dev Notes

### Business Logic Differences

**Service Billing vs Retail Billing:**

- No inventory management or stock deduction
- Direct bill creation without product catalog
- Flexible service descriptions (text input vs product selection)
- Manual payment status management
- Focus on client relationship management

### Data Models

**Service Bill Schema:**

```javascript
{
  shop: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'Shop', required: true },
  billNumber: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  invoiceNumber: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  customer: {
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    phone: { type: String, required: true },
    address: { type: String }
  },
  serviceItems: [{
    date: { type: Date, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    amount: { type: Number, required: true }
  }],
  totalAmount: { type: Number, required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['Pending', 'Received'], default: 'Pending' },
  paymentMode: { type: String, default: 'Pending' },
  businessType: { type: String, default: 'Service' },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  updatedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}
```

### API Specifications

**Service Bills Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/service-bills` - Get paginated bill history with filters
- `POST /api/service-bills` - Create new service bill
- `PUT /api/service-bills/:id` - Update existing bill
- `GET /api/service-bills/stats` - Get dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/service-bills/:id/print` - Get printable bill format

**Query Parameters:**

- `page` - Page number for pagination
- `limit` - Items per page
- `status` - Filter by bill status
- `dateFrom` - Start date filter
- `dateTo` - End date filter

### Component Structure

```
src/components/billing/service/
├── ServiceBillingInterface.jsx     - Main container
├── DashboardCards.jsx              - Daily collection & pending cards
├── ServiceBillForm.jsx             - Bill creation form
├── ServiceRowInput.jsx             - Individual service row
├── BillHistoryTable.jsx            - Bill history with dual edit modes
├── BillEditModal.jsx               - Full bill editing modal
├── PrintableBill.jsx               - Print template
└── BillSearchFilter.jsx            - Search and filter controls
```

### Business Type Routing Logic

```javascript
// In billing route, detect business type and render appropriate interface
const BillingPage = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const businessType = user?.shop?.business_type;

  if (businessType === "Freelancer or Service") {
    return <ServiceBillingInterface />;
  } else {
    return <RetailBillingInterface />; // Existing Story 3.1
  }
};
```

### Print Template Requirements

**Bill Header:**

- Shop name, address, phone, GST (if applicable)
- Invoice number and date
- Client details

**Bill Body:**

- Service date, description, amount in tabular format
- Total amount prominently displayed

**Footer:**

- Legal compliance note: "This is a computer-generated invoice and does not require signature. Please retain this copy for your records."
- Payment terms and contact information

### Mobile Responsiveness

- Dashboard cards stack vertically on mobile
- Form fields adapt to smaller screens
- Table becomes horizontally scrollable on mobile
- Print functionality works on mobile browsers

## Testing

**Testing Requirements:**

- Unit tests for all service billing components
- Integration tests for bill creation and editing flow
- Print functionality testing across browsers
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- API endpoint testing with various scenarios
- Dashboard statistics calculation testing

**Test Scenarios:**

- Create bill with single service item
- Create bill with multiple service items
- Edit bill status and payment mode
- Search and filter bill history
- Print bill functionality
- Dashboard statistics accuracy
- Form validation edge cases
